<h1>PDF Form Filler Web Service</h1>
<h4>Project developed for VanHackathon in November/2019</h4>
<p>
This application is a REST Web Service that receives a PDF Form document 
and fills its fields according to input data. The intent is to
use this web service to automatically fill Canada's Global Talent Stream Application,
but it can be used to fill in any PDF Form.
<p>
This project was developed using:
Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB and PDFBox.
